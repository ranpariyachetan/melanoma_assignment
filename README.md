## General Information
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. The goal of this project is to develop a CNN model using Tensoflow which can classify images in malignant and benign oncological diseases.

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Conclusions
- The dataset has class imbalance. 
- After addressing class imbalance accuracy of model increased significantly.
- Image augmentation also helped taking of overfitting issue.
